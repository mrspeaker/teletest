# Teletest

Eventually, the initiator of this session will close it and we'll not be able to join in anymore. Would love to see the end result posted somewhere. :)

	1. who cares?
	2. shouldn't you be working , anyway? (Yes. But this is more fun. Also, I just told folks I _am_ working.)
		- reconnaissance. (I work at GitHub so this is actually related to my work.)  add voice chat to this.

*HERE YOU GO! [TeleTest](https://github.com/mrspeaker/teletest)*
		Woo! Thanks @mrspeaker!  
    - No problem ;) Need to automate the committing now!

PRO TIP: Hit `CTRL+SHIFT+M` (or `COMMAND+SHIFT+M` on Mac?) to render this Markdown document in another pane. It updates with all the live changes.

:point_up: It's `CTRL+SHIFT+M` on mac too!

**Neat work on Teletype yo! :thumbs_up:**

- Google Wave 2.0! <-- notice what happens when I put an ampersand (what?) (give it a try)(where?)
		- that's an issue with the markdown highlighting.yup. issue raised already.
- Google Wave was da bomb! (+1... sad it died)
🎊🎉

interesting.  vim-mode-plus already crashed this for me.  can anyone read this? yep
^ I had some problems earlier on with linters trying to lint files on other people's hard drives :-P

__Can anyone create new files? Or only edit existing?__

^ collaborators can edit the active file only, but the active file can change... (eg the portal host could switch to README2.md and that's what we'd all be seeing)
	Imagine project sharing... oooh.
	I was hoping it would share the entire project, but it's still pretty cool
  ^ Can everyone see the other filenames in the project? (There are 2 files - README.md and README2.md)
	Whoa, stole your focus, that was weird
	I cannot see the other filenames...I think
	Wow, that was abrupt...definitely need some form of communication as well.
^^ This is really sweet - great work!
Glad you are liking it! :)

__What software would you use for group voice chat?  That seems to be the only missing part of a true collaboration.  Discord?__
^riot.im seems interesting
^ While building Teletype, we used Slack calls for voice chat. Given that we're using WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication, we'd love to see voice chat integrated into Teletype one day. 🤞
^ yeah, please get on that next before Microsoft beats you to that feature.. or jetbrains
^^ Should integrate with VSCode too, so doesn't matter which editor you're using can collaborate ;)
^^^ Could that work if there was a plugin that used teletype-crdt?

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man... and so forth.  

This seems very nice. @jbrooksuk! :)
Yeah, very slick!

__Anyone try it out in a remote pairing scenario yet?__

^ We built Teletype for Atom across 2 continents and 3 timezones. So, yes. 😇
*thumbs up emoji*

Wow, [teletype-crdt](https://github.com/atom/teletype-crdt) looks REALLY cool... need to delve into that one!

```js
const pretendingToWork = true;

const primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97];
```

♪♫ I stole a prime, and it opened up my eyes I stole a prime
Math is demanding without my understanding ♪♫♬...wuh, oh ohhh

```python
primelist = lambda n : [x for x in range(2, n) if not 0 in map(lambda z : x % z, range(2,x))]
primelist(100)
```

```bash
rm -rf ~/meme_picz
```

This is working pretty well with a bunch of people :)
   - how do we know they aren't bots?  this is 2017, after all.  fake code.
   - How can I test if I'm a bot?
	 - Please click each image of a tree to prove you are not a robot
	 - AHHHHHHhhhhhhhh!!! whew.  ok, that was bad.

can I inject malicious code here that runs on your pc?
^ Atom doesn't automatically run code in the editor. It'd require someone actually doing something to execute it. So the general rule of thumb is don't pair with people you don't trust. Except in Markdown documents maybe. :)

**I trust you lot** (AWWWW!)
^ "I TRUST YOU" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhInj0ZHNC8

Would be cool to push code changes to production live... oh the chaos!
^ such choas! 🙉

OMG - this is like Slack, except your manager will think you're working.
^ :point_up: (Not enough like Slack. :P).Is there an Atom package for turning :smile: into unicode emojis? Hmmm.... I think I may be nerd sniping myself.
^ 😂
^ Just be careful if they find your portal ID 😉
^ I've seen the authors script entire documents before in demos, it was great to see them stop typing and it kept going.
^ OH! That gives me a great idea for my next talk. I hate doing live coding demos. So maybe I could have a partner behind the curtains do the coding while I blabber on.
^^ Ha ha, great idea - but you should pretend to be typing so it looks like you are talking and coding at the same time like a master

What is the personal hotspot icon doing when i click on people?
^ ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38/32853588-c2e4376e-ca09-11e7-9deb-8a6dd1de173e.png)
^^ It shows that you're following that person. As they navigate elsewhere in the doc, your editor will scroll so that you're seeing the same thing that person is seeing. At any time, you can click on someone else to follow them. Or, if you scroll on your own or start typing, Teletype assumes that don't want to follow that person right now.

* Is there any "blame" on the edits, or once it's done it's just a single file?
^ For now, it's a single file produced collaboratively by all participants. We're _very_ open to feedback about use cases that bring benefits to devs. So, let us know (https://discuss.atom.io/). :-)
^^ I think for 80% of cases that's good enough anyhoo... normally it wouldn't be randos editing
^^^ Indeed
^^ Yeah, in practice I'd imagine that the pair would discuss what to commit as they work.

- How did you do the avatars? That's great how they reposition as you scroll.
^ Thanks! You can follow someone by clicking on their avatar, or you're free to roam the document on your own, in which case you see which participants are above your or below you.

How many people can join? (remember when Google wave first went public and there were thousands of people on one document (wavelet? what were they called?)... that was chaos xD )
^ We're not sure, but thanks to whomever started this for the stress test. Many of the Atom team are in here as curious about this question as you are. :)
^ Indeed! I expect the social constraints to outweigh the technical constraints. How many people is it _useful_ to write code with in real-time? 😀
^ We've used it for note-taking in meetings too which is handy and can involve a decent number of people

I can see the avatars of the collaborators but I can't click on them to see who these "people" are.
^ Yeah, there will be a lot more work done in that area. I'd love to highlight an avatar and see information and perhaps locations where they've edited. Feel free to log issues here: https://github.com/atom/teletype/issues/new

Looks like we need to go deeper!
